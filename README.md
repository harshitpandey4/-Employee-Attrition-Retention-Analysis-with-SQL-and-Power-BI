# Overview
This project analyzes employee attrition trends and their underlying causes using structured SQL queries and visualizations built in Power BI. The dataset simulates employee data from a company modeled on Gran Grans Foods, based on behavioral, managerial, and compensation-related insights derived from the company’s compliance and turnover analysis.

The core goal is to identify key factors contributing to high employee turnover—especially in departments like Research & Development—and develop actionable strategies to mitigate attrition using real-time analytics.
